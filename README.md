# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

This directory contains projects in C language focused on Sorting Algorithms.

It has the following General Learning Objectives:
* At least four different sorting algorithms
* What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of
  an algorithm
* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
* What is a stable sorting algorithm
